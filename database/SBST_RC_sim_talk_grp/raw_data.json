        "**Basic Level Practice**\n\nThis section focuses on basic communication practices and habits for radio communication (RC) comms. It is designed to reinforce what has been learned in previous modules, with a focus on call-signs and message context.\n\n**Good Comms Practices and Habits:**\n\n1. **Making a Group Call (only by control centre, not individuals):**\n   - The sender initiates the call by stating the receiver's call sign, followed by their own call sign and the message.\n   - Example: \"<Receiver’s Call Sign> this is <Sender’s Call Sign>, <Message>, over\"\n   - Example: \"<Car 45> this is <Mainline 01>, <Message>, over\"\n\n2. **Individuals Establishing a Call:**\n   - When a receiver's radio call alert sounds, the receiver responds by acknowledging the call sign and indicating readiness to receive the message.\n   - Example: \"<Receiver’s Call Sign>, send, over\"\n   - Example: \"<Car 45>, send, over\"\n\n3. **Subsequent Radio Messages:**\n   - Messages exchanged between the receiver and sender should start with the sender's call sign and end with \"over.\" The final message should end with \"out.\"\n   - Example: \"<Your own Call Sign> <Your Message>, over\"\n   - Example: \"<Car 45>, <Message>, over\"\n\n4. **Leaving Radio Comms:**\n   - The sender concludes communication by ending with \"over and out.\"\n   - Example: \"<Your own Call Sign> <Your Message>, over and out.\"\n   - Example: \"<Car 45>, <Message>, over and out.\"\n\nThese practices ensure clear and effective communication in radio operations.",
        "**Radio Communication Protocol**\n\nThis image illustrates a conversation using a radio communication protocol. The exchange involves a player and a control center, highlighting the importance of using specific procedures for clarity and identification.\n\n1. **Initiation**: The player begins with a simple greeting, \"Hello.\"\n\n2. **Control Center Response**: The control center responds by reminding the player to start messages with \"TPO\" for clarity and to follow the radio communication protocol. This ensures that messages are clear and properly formatted.\n\n3. **Identification Request**: The control center requests the player to provide a call sign for identification purposes. This is crucial in radio communications to ensure that all parties are correctly identified and messages are directed appropriately.\n\n4. **Reiteration**: The control center repeats the request for the call sign, emphasizing the need for proper protocol adherence.\n\nThe image also features a Tetra Radio, which is a type of communication device used in professional settings for secure and reliable communication. The visual emphasizes the importance of using standardized communication methods in radio operations.",
        "The image shows a smartphone displaying a communication interface that resembles a radio system. The screen includes a conversation between a \"Player\" and \"Ram,\" who appears to be a control center operator. The dialogue emphasizes the importance of using proper communication protocols, specifically mentioning \"TOP\" for clarity and identification.\n\nIn the center of the screen, there is an image of a TETRA radio device, which is commonly used for secure and reliable communication in professional settings. The bottom of the phone screen features the logo of \"SBS Transit,\" suggesting a connection to a transportation service.\n\nThe overall theme of the image is about maintaining clear and effective communication, likely in a transit or operational context, using both digital and traditional radio methods."
