Abstract of the Proposal \n\nYes \n\n√ \n\nNo \n\n√ \n\n√ \n\n√ \n\n√ \n\nTraining  in  specialized  ﬁelds demands extensive onboarding and refresher programs, yet \ncurrent  instructor-led  and  peer-based  methods  are  resource-intensive,  inconsistent,  and \nlack scalability due to variations in trainer expertise and engagement. This study proposes \na  Retrieval-Augmented  Generation  (RAG)  -enabled  Generative  AI  (Gen-AI)  chatbot  to \ndeliver a scalable, structured, and adaptive conversational training solution. \n\nThe  chatbot  system  offers  three  proﬁciency  levels  (Basic,  Intermediate,  and  Advanced), \nscenario-based  simulations,  real-time  feedback,  and  adaptive  learning  paths,  accessible \nthrough  an  intuitive  user  interface.  By  leveraging  RAG,  the  chatbot  ensures  consistent \ntraining  quality,  personalized  learning  experiences,  and  the  ability  to  simulate  complex, \nreal-world interactions dynamically. \n\nTrainers can evaluate trainee performance, review chat interactions, and grade responses \nwhile  trainees  engage in immersive, role-speciﬁc conversational exercises. This AI-driven \napproach  enhances  training  eﬃciency,  standardization,  and  preparedness,  signiﬁcantly \nreducing reliance on resource-heavy methods while addressing gaps in traditional training \nparadigms. \n\n6. Details of Research Proposal \n\nProblem Statement \nEffective  radio communications training is essential across specialized ﬁelds, yet current \nonboarding  and \ntime-consuming  and  resource-intensive. \nTraditional training methods rely on instructor supervision, leading to variability in training \nquality  due  to  instructor  bias  and  personal  teaching styles. This challenge is particularly \nevident in the bus service industry, where bus captains must frequently communicate with \nHQ control rooms to report road conditions and incidents. Inconsistent training can result \n\nrefresher  programs  are \n\nPage 2 of 13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPrincipal Investigator:  \nDr. Kendrik Yan Hong Lim \n\nAviation Virtual Pte Ltd. \n\nin miscommunication, operational ineﬃciencies, and compromised situational awareness, \nhighlighting the need for a scalable and standardized training solution. \n\nResearch Gaps \n1. Scalability and accessibility \n\ntrainers.  Peer-to-peer \n\nTraditional  instructor-led  training  is  resource-intensive  and constrained by the availability \nof  skilled \nin \ninconsistencies  due  to  varying  trainee  competencies  and  engagement levels. As such, a \nscalable  solution  is  required  to  ensure  uniform  training  standards  and  access  without \nover-reliance on human instructors. \n\ntraining,  while  an  alternative,  often \n\nresults \n\n2. Consistent training quality \nThe  effectiveness  of  training  is  highly  dependent  on  the  experience  and  engagement of \ntrainers, leading to inconsistencies in learning outcomes. Peer-to-peer methods may fail to \ncover  all  necessary  scenarios  comprehensively,  resulting  in  gaps  in  preparedness  and \noperational eﬃciency. \n\n3. Personalized feedback and adaptation \nExisting  training  approaches  lack  dynamic  adaptation  to  individual  learning  styles  and \nperformance.  Without  real-time  feedback  and  tailored  learning  pathways,  trainees  may \nstruggle  to  reinforce  key  concepts  effectively,  leading  to  slower  skill  acquisition  and \nreduced conﬁdence in communication. \n\n4. Handing complex, dynamic situations \nSimulating  realistic,  high-pressure  scenarios  remains  a  challenge  in  traditional  training \nmethods. Many existing programs fail to expose trainees to the full spectrum of possible \nincidents,  limiting  their  ability  to  develop  critical  decision-making  and  response  skills  in \nunpredictable situations. \n\nProposed Methodology/ Solution \n\nThis  study  proposes  a  Generative  AI-based  conversational  training  program designed to \ntrain and evaluate SBS trainees. The system will leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation \n(RAG)  to  deliver  a  comprehensive,  adaptive,  and  personalized  learning  experience, \nenhancing training eﬃciency while maintaining scalability and consistency. \n\nStakeholders and System Functionality \nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the system involves two primary stakeholders: \n\n● \n\nInstructors: Responsible for training, evaluating scenario-based engagements, and \ngrading trainee performance. \n\n●  Trainees: Assume bus driver or HQ operator roles, engaging in conversational \n\nPage 3 of 13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPrincipal Investigator:  \nDr. Kendrik Yan Hong Lim \n\nAviation Virtual Pte Ltd. \n\ntraining with the AI chatbot. Their performance is assessed based on response \naccuracy, adherence to protocols, and communication effectiveness. \n\nFigure 1: Overview of AI-Chatbot functionalities. \n\nSystem Framework and Development \nThe  chatbot  system  is  designed  as  a  functional  and  deployable  training  solution  with  a \nfocus  on  reliability  and  practical  applicability.  To  validate  the  effectiveness  of  the  RAG \nmodel,  the  prototype  integrates  existing  open-source  tools  and  solutions  within  a \nuser-friendly interface. \n\nAs  shown  in  Figure  2,  the  framework  outlines  the  process  ﬂow  of  the  chatbot  system, \nillustrating  how  it  retrieves,  processes,  and  generates  responses  tailored  to  the  training \ncontext.  The  chatbot  interacts  dynamically  with  trainees,  adapting  to  different  learning \nlevels and providing corrective feedback in real time. \n\nFigure 2: Framework of prototype Chatbot system. \n\nPage 4 of 13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPrincipal Investigator:  \nDr. Kendrik Yan Hong Lim \n\nAviation Virtual Pte Ltd. \n\nProject Objectives \nThis project aims to achieve the following key objectives: \n\n●  Multi-Level Learning: Implement three diﬃculty levels (Basic, Intermediate, \n\nAdvanced) to enhance the learning experience progressively. \n\n●  Data-Driven Training: Utilize trainer evaluation metrics and past training recordings \n\nto improve training accuracy and contextual relevance. \n\n●  User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive UI for both trainees and trainers to \n\nensure ease of use and eﬃcient navigation. \n\n●  Scenario-Based Training: Incorporate realistic training scenarios for specialized \n\nrecaps, incident handling, and situational retraining. \n\nPrototype Development Scope \nThe initial proof-of-concept (POC) will focus on delivering a functional AI chatbot with a \nhigh degree of accuracy. The primary goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of the \nRAG-powered chatbot for structured conversational training. \n\nAs depicted in Figures 3 and 4, the system features distinct interfaces for trainees and \ninstructors: \n\n●  Trainee Interface (Figure 3): Provides scenario prompts, real-time AI-generated \n\n● \n\nfeedback, and an interactive chat window for training exercises. \nInstructor Interface (Figure 4): Includes a dashboard for monitoring trainee \nprogress, reviewing chat records, and assigning scenario-based training modules. \n\nFigure 2: Interface as seen by a trainee. \n\nPage 5 of 13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPrincipal Investigator:  \nDr. Kendrik Yan Hong Lim \n\nAviation Virtual Pte Ltd. \n\nFigure 3: Interface as seen by an instructor. \n\nBy integrating RAG-based retrieval, personalized adaptation, and real-time evaluation, this \nsolution  aims  to  bridge  existing  training  gaps,  reduce  reliance  on  resource-intensive \nmethods,  and  provide  a  scalable,  high-quality  training  experience  for  specialized  radio \ncommunications. \n\nData Requirements/ Required Resources \nThe  accuracy  of  the  Chatbot  is  highly  dependent  on  the  quality,  completeness,  and \nrelevance of the training data provided. Its effectiveness in delivering accurate responses, \nsimulating  realistic  scenarios,  and  adapting  to  trainees'  learning  needs  relies  on \nwell-structured  training  materials,  past  recordings,  evaluation  metrics,  and  standardized \ncommunication  protocols. Insuﬃcient or low-quality data may hinder the chatbot's ability \nto generate precise, context-aware responses, ultimately impacting the system's reliability \nand  training  effectiveness.  Therefore,  ensuring  access  to  high-quality,  domain-speciﬁc \ndata is critical to achieving the desired learning outcomes and validating the feasibility of \nthis AI-driven training solution. \n\n1. Training materials, Standard Operating Procedures, etc. \n\nPage 6 of 13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPrincipal Investigator:  \nDr. Kendrik Yan Hong Lim \n\nAviation Virtual Pte Ltd. \n\n2. Past training recordings, evaluation metrics, etc. \n\nSolution Requirements \nThe  primary  goal  of  this  project  is  to  develop  a  high-accuracy,  AI-driven  conversational \ntraining chatbot. To ensure its effectiveness, human-driven experiments will be conducted \nto  test  and  evaluate  system  performance  alongside  benchmark  metrics  that  assess \nusability, accuracy, and the chatbot’s ability to deliver intuitive interactions. \n\nObjectives: \n\n●  Scalable and Accessible Training: Develop a 24/7 available chatbot that ensures \n\nconsistent training standards and allows seamless content updates. \n\n●  Knowledge-Driven Conversational Training: Implement a RAG-enabled chatbot \n\ncapable of retrieving relevant and accurate training scenarios from a structured \nknowledge base, enhancing trainees’ conversational experiences. \n\n●  Personalized Feedback and Adaptation: Enable the chatbot to dynamically adapt to \ntrainee responses and performance in real time, providing personalized feedback \nto optimize learning outcomes. \n\n●  Realistic Scenario Simulation: Ensure the chatbot can simulate diverse and \n\ncomplex scenarios using dynamic, up-to-date information, preparing trainees \nthrough immersive, realistic experiences. \n\nChatbot Model Requirements \n\n●  Domain-Speciﬁc  Understanding:  The  chatbot  must  accurately  process  and  apply \n\ncommunication standards, including callsigns and protocols (e.g., “over”). \n\n●  High  Accuracy  and  Consistency:  Unlike  rigid  rule-based  systems,  the  chatbot \nshould  function  as  a  dynamic  model  with  an  accuracy target of 95% or higher to \nensure consistency in responses. \n\n●  Lightweight  UI  and  Scalable  Backend:  A  minimalist  front-end  interface  will  be \ndeveloped  for  usability  testing,  while  the  backend will be hosted on a local/cloud \nserver for scalability and future integration. \n\n●  Text-Based  Interaction:  The  initial  proof-of-concept  (POC)  will  focus  on  written \ncommunication  only,  excluding  voice  conversion,  virtual  environments,  or  other \nimmersive features in this phase. \n\n●  Data-Driven  Training:  The  chatbot  will  require  text-based  training  data,  including \nreal-life voice recordings (converted to text), training documentation, best practice \ntemplates,  and  high-quality  artiﬁcially  generated  examples  to  improve  model \nrobustness. \n\nBy  meeting  these  requirements,  the  chatbot  will  bridge  existing  training  gaps,  enhance \nlearning  eﬃciency,  and  ensure adaptability to real-world operational scenarios, ultimately \nimproving the quality and scalability of specialized communications training. \n\nPage 7 of 13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPrincipal Investigator:  \nDr. Kendrik Yan Hong Lim \n\nAviation Virtual Pte Ltd. \n\nIn-Scope/ Out-of-Scope \nIn-Scope \n\n●  Basic UI for user testing and prototype demonstration. \n●  Benchmark the RAG Chatbot model against commercial solutions. \n●  Develop 2 related scenarios for conversational training. \n\nOut-of-Scope \n\n●  Capabilities related to Voice-to-Chat or vice versa. \n●  XR-related functionalities in the solution. \n●  Avatar features and advanced front-end integration. \n\nSolution Beneﬁts/ Novelty of Innovation \nThis  project  introduces  unique  innovations  that  differentiate  it  from  existing  market \nin  specialized \nsolutions,  offering  enhanced  accuracy,  eﬃciency,  and  scalability \nconversational training. \n\n1.

        "**Declaration of Ethics Consideration**\n\nThe document outlines the ethical considerations for a research proposal. It confirms that the study does not involve human subjects, human tissues or cells, animal experimentation, or the use of animal tissues or cells. Additionally, there is no requirement for containment.\n\n**Abstract of the Proposal**\n\nThe proposal addresses the challenges in training for specialized fields, which require extensive onboarding and refresher programs. Current methods are resource-intensive, inconsistent, and lack scalability due to variations in trainer expertise. The study proposes a solution using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enabled Generative AI (Gen-AI) chatbot. This system aims to provide scalable, structured, and adaptive conversational training.\n\nThe chatbot offers three proficiency levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced. It includes scenario-based simulations, real-time feedback, and adaptive learning paths, all accessible through an intuitive user interface. By leveraging RAG, the chatbot ensures consistent training quality, personalized learning experiences, and the ability to simulate complex real-world interactions.\n\nTrainers can evaluate performance, review interactions, and grade responses, while trainees engage in immersive, role-specific exercises. This AI-driven approach enhances efficiency, standardization, and preparedness, reducing reliance on resource-heavy methods and addressing gaps in traditional training paradigms.\n\n**Details of Research Proposal**\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThe proposal highlights the necessity of effective radio communications training in specialized fields. Current onboarding and refresher programs are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Traditional methods depend heavily on instructor supervision, leading to variability in training quality due to instructor bias and personal teaching styles. This issue is particularly evident in the bus service industry, where bus captains must frequently communicate with HQ control rooms to report conditions and incidents. Inconsistent training can result in significant challenges.",
        "**Research Gaps and Proposed Methodology**\n\n**Research Gaps**\n\n1. **Scalability and Accessibility**\n   - Traditional instructor-led training is resource-intensive and limited by the availability of skilled trainers. Peer-to-peer training can lead to inconsistencies due to varying competencies and engagement levels among trainees. A scalable solution is needed to ensure uniform training standards without over-relying on human instructors.\n\n2. **Consistent Training Quality**\n   - The effectiveness of training depends heavily on the trainers' experience and engagement, leading to inconsistent learning outcomes. Peer-to-peer methods may not cover all necessary scenarios, resulting in gaps in preparedness and operational efficiency.\n\n3. **Personalized Feedback and Adaptation**\n   - Current training approaches lack dynamic adaptation to individual learning styles and performance. Without real-time feedback and tailored learning pathways, trainees may struggle to reinforce key concepts, leading to slower skill acquisition and reduced communication confidence.\n\n4. **Handling Complex, Dynamic Situations**\n   - Simulating realistic, high-pressure scenarios is challenging in traditional training methods. Many programs fail to expose trainees to the full range of possible incidents, limiting their ability to develop critical decision-making and response skills in unpredictable situations.\n\n**Proposed Methodology/Solution**\n\n- The study proposes a Generative AI-based conversational training program for SBS trainees. This system will use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide a comprehensive, adaptive, and personalized learning experience, enhancing training efficiency while maintaining scalability and consistency.\n\n**Stakeholders and System Functionality**\n\n- The system involves two primary stakeholders:\n  - **Instructors**: Responsible for training, evaluating scenario-based engagements, and grading trainee performance.\n  - **Trainees**: Assume roles such as bus driver or HQ operator, engaging in conversational training.",
