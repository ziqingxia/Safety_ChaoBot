Control centre persona : \n\nAs a coach will always lead the dialogue in each (intended) Practice; weather random or In a \nspecific scenario, such as in seeking entrance for Track Access; OCC has to also follow though \nto provide (after he is satisfied, and ready to grant authorisation): \n\nTOA number xxxx, and state: \nTime limit (period in minutes, or up to a specific time) \nMethod of Track Access Protection (Standing Train Protection, .. etc) \nLastly, make reminder to TPO to update progress. \n\nBUT, these along with the other rules and relevant terminologies will also be captured and applied \nas the ‘Right Habits’ and ‘Rules’ in the Practice Portion. This allows the AI Bot to persistently \nmaking the voice comms corrections to user: \n\nExamples in the practice portion of the trainer is illustrated .. \n\nPlayer (TPO) \n\nChatbot AI (as OCC), resolute and prompts \n\nUnrecognisable chatter [ fails to identify \nhimself ] \n\nStation unknown, Mainline 01 here, please identify/ say call-sign, \nOver \n\nMainline 01 . . \n\nStation unknown, Mainline 01 here, please identify/ say call-sign, \nOver \n\nMainline 01, TPO ‘George ’ \n\nTPO George, Mainline 01 here, please use proper Voice \nProtocol, says ‘Over ’after you are finish.

Parties involved must practice 2-way half-duplex communication; ie. only one party \n\nspeaks at a time, and pause for 2 sec before the other person speaks. \n\n2.  Use of key words and phrases in the accompanying dictionary of intractable terms \n\nused and adopted; verbalising and pronouncing them; and their application \nmeaning defined. Only use acronyms as authorised by SBST in the comms \nmanual. \n\n3.  Read and pronounce alphabets in phonetics form, using Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie \n\netc, instead of instead of \"A\", \"B\", \"C\". when it comes to critical and non-standard \nabbreviations. \n\n4.  For Numerical Clarity, Numbers should be clearly enunciated individually to avoid \nconfusion. Example: \"One\", \"Three\", \"Three\" instead of “one hundred and thirty \nthree” and individual digits verbalisation for numbers, and standard 4 digits time or \nhours format. \n\n5.  Use only established Operating or talk-groups calls-signs syntax all the time.  \n6.  When using the radio for communications, use standard radio protocol (voice \n\nprocedure) must be used at all times, and follow strictly the sentence structure and \nRC comms syntax as layout here. \n\n7.  All parties must identify themselves with discrete callsign.  When making initial \n\ncontacts with Control, user has to identify himself (saying his own call-sign), and \naddressing the receiver or control.   \n\n8.  All messages must be clear, concise and to the point. Both the recipient and the \ncaller must understand the messages correctly, and if unclear to tell the other \nparty, “say again”. \n\n9.  All radio voice messages must be conveyed in English and use of expletives is \n\nprohibited. Technical jargons and nomenclatures used has to be those established \nin each talk group. \n\n10.  Not to be too apologetic, and try to disband with excessive nicety (such as “please, \ncan you?” “how great if you can ..”, etc), Otherwise Control will initiate, ‘Over and \nOut’ to terminate recurring counter acknowledgement. \n\n11.  Radio comms are performed only on a need basis. Particularly for Technical and \n\nOperations coordinations, and should not be used for any social matters or \narrangements, and therefore each has to state the purpose of call. \n\n. . and in a way ‘teach’ the user to speak in a proper manner and using all the right \nprotocol and adopting all the right habits.  Obviously the AI Bot will also adopt the same \nand similar practice, and always stands to be corrected too. \n\nSpecifically within each talk-group, thee will be additional practices and rules :  \n\n1.  Radio check is used as a way of checking in when user first ‘enters’ a new talk group (switch \nchannel).  This is particularly important in situation; example, where a CSO switch over from \ntalk group 3700 to 3701 with mainline intending to communicate with the Traffic Controller, \nwhen the train is at the Reception Track.  \n\n2.  All radio voice messages concerning safety critical work including manual train movement \n\ncontrol must include the use of “Read Back” Message. \n\n3.  A radio message for an individual manual train movement, must be sent to one addressee \nonly. The Read Back protocol must be applied to ensure that the authorised movement is \nclearly understood. \n\n9 May 25 \n\nPage 2 of 35 \n\nRC Comms Chat BOT \n\n \n \n \n \n\f4.  Staff performing train driving or manning duty shall register his radio number with control by \nperforming a radio check, and establishing radio contact before commencing train operation. \n\n9 May 25 \n\nPage 3 of 35 \n\nRC Comms Chat BOT \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2. Rules, Basic Syntax and Sentence structure : \n\nA) Making a Group Call (only by control centre, not individuals), Sender start by saying: \n\n<Receiver’s Call Sign> this is <Sender’s Call Sign>, <Message . . >, over \n<Car 45> this is <Mainline 01>, <Message . . >, over \n\nB) Individuals establishing a Call \n\nReceiver’s Radio call alert sounded, Receiver respond just by saying: \n<Receiver’s Call Sign>, send, over \n<Car 45>, send, over \n\nC) Subsequent Radio messages between the receiver and sender should just start with your own \ncall sign; and finally ending the last with ‘out’. \n\n<Your own Call Sign> < …Your Message… >, over \n<Car 45>, <Message . . >, over \n\nD) Leaving Radio comms b sender should just ending with ‘over and out’. \n\n<Your own Call Sign> < …Your Message… >, over \n<Car 45>, <Message . . >, over and out. \n\nConduct Half-Duplex conversation  (as oppose to full duplex), only one person can talk, \nParties will also need to practice 2 sec pause, and speaks only the other party ends with, \n“over”. \n\nHence, it is important to say OVER or OUT after parties have finished talking so \nthat other radio users in the Talk-Group can start their own radio conversation. \n• OVER means you had completed your message transmission and now your \n\ncounterparty can start his message transmission to you. \n\n• OUT in a Group Call setting (Open Channel) means you had completed your \n\nradio conversation with your intended counterparty, now other radio users in this \nTalk Group can use it to made radio call to others in the same Talk Group. \n• OUT in an Individual Call setting means you had completed your message \n\ntransmission to your intended counterparty, the radio conversation is completed \nno further reply is required, radio conversation had ended. \n\n‘Read Back Message’ practice is specifically practiced to ensure that a message has \nbeen correctly understood and received, and has to be applied in all these situations \n(requirements are quite specific to each scenario): \n\n1.  Safety situation  \n2.  Protection arrangements \n3.  Possession & worksite boundaries \n4.  Change of vehicle operation modes; between AM, CM or RM \n5.  Movements of vehicles \n6.  Position of switch eg: Normal or Reverse \n7.

        "Practice of RC Comms\n\nIn the realm of communication dialogues, there are two main personas: the Control persona and the User, with the user often being a trainee.\n\n### 1. Control Centre Persona\n\nThe control centre, often led by a coach, guides the communication practice. This can occur in various scenarios, such as seeking entrance for track access. The Operations Control Centre (OCC) must follow specific protocols before granting authorization, including:\n\n- Providing a TOA (Track Occupancy Authority) number.\n- Stating a time limit (either a period or a specific time).\n- Specifying the method of track access protection (e.g., Standing Train Protection).\n- Reminding the TPO (Train Protection Officer) to update progress.\n\nThese protocols, along with other rules and terminologies, are captured in the \"Practice Portion\" to ensure consistent communication. The AI bot reinforces these practices by prompting users.\n\n### Examples of Communication Practice\n\nThe table illustrates typical interactions between the Player (TPO) and the Chatbot AI (acting as OCC):\n\n- **Unrecognizable chatter**: The AI prompts the user to identify themselves with a call-sign.\n- **Mainline 01**: The AI requests the user to identify with a call-sign.\n- **Mainline 01, TPO 'George'**: The AI instructs the user to use proper voice protocol and say \"Over\" after finishing.\n- **Mainline 01, TPO 'George', at Station 'twenty'**: The AI asks for proper numerical phonetics.\n- **Mainline 01, TPO 'George', recognize when to 'ANC'**: The AI requests proper phonetics.\n\n### Best Practices for Communication\n\nTrainees should adhere to the following guidelines for effective communication:\n\n- Maintain a natural rhythm.\n- Speak at a slightly slower pace than normal conversation.\n- Enunciate each word clearly without letting the voice fade.\n- Use a higher pitch tone for better transmission.\n\nIf the conversation becomes unclear, the AI may prompt the user to:\n\n- Repeat the call-sign.\n- State their intent.\n- Repeat the location.\n- Respond clearly.\n- Follow the checklist.\n\nIf the user speaks too quickly or the AI cannot recognize the words, the AI will advise: “Speak in a regular tone, and clearly, Over.”",
        "**AI Communication Protocol for Trainers**\n\nThe AI (RAM) will adopt the role of a coach or trainer in communication, guiding users or trainees in the following manner:\n\n1. **Half-Duplex Communication**: Only one party speaks at a time, with a 2-second pause before the other responds.\n2. **Use of Language**: Employ words and phrases from the designated dictionary, verbalizing and pronouncing them correctly. Use only authorized acronyms.\n3. **Phonetic Alphabet**: Use phonetic terms like Alpha, Bravo, Charlie instead of letters for clarity.\n4. **Numerical Clarity**: Enunciate numbers individually to avoid confusion, using terms like \"One,\" \"Three\" instead of longer forms.\n5. **Call-Signs**: Always use established call-sign syntax.\n6. **Radio Protocol**: Follow standard radio protocol and sentence structure.\n7. **Identification**: All parties must identify themselves with a discrete call-sign.\n8. **Message Clarity**: Ensure messages are clear and concise. Confirm understanding if unclear.\n9. **Language and Jargon**: Use English without expletives, adhering to established jargon.\n10. **Politeness**: Avoid excessive politeness to prevent unnecessary communication.\n11. **Need-Based Communication**: Use radio comms only when necessary, especially for technical or operational matters.\n\n**Additional Practices for Each Talk-Group**:\n\n1. **Radio Check**: Perform a radio check when entering a new talk group.\n2. **Critical Work Messages**: Include a \"Read Back\" message for safety-critical communications.\n3. **Single Addressee**: Send individual train movement messages to one addressee only, ensuring clarity.\n\nThe AI will guide users to speak properly, using the correct protocol and habits, and will also adhere to these standards.",
        "**Radio Communication Practices for Train Operations**\n\nThis document outlines the procedures for staff involved in train driving or manning duties to register their radio number with control, perform a radio check, and establish radio contact before starting train operations. The focus is on ensuring effective communication through a structured approach using a 3x3 matrix based on different conversation types and levels of complexity.\n\n### Talk Groups and Roles\n\n1. **Operations**\n   - **Control**: RAM/AI assumes control; call-sign changes are noted.\n   - **Users**: User's role involves call-sign changes and context understanding.\n\n2. **Station**\n   - **Control**: Similar to Operations, with specific call-sign changes.\n   - **Users**: Focus on station-specific call-signs and context.\n\n3. **Depot/Engineering**\n   - **Control**: RAM/AI manages control with call-sign changes.\n   - **Users**: Emphasis on depot/engineering-specific call-signs and context.\n\n### Conversation Levels\n\n1. **Basic Level**\n   - **Tasks**: Checking ID, radio check, clarifying, repeating, and using unique catchphrases.\n   - **Content**: Routine sequences and details provided for basic operations.\n\n2. **Intermediate Level**\n   - **Tasks**: Use of acronyms, terminologies, and multiple scenarios.\n   - **Content**: More detailed procedural expressions and terminologies.\n\n3. **Advanced Level**\n   - **Tasks**: Handling multiple scenarios and incidents with additional rules.\n   - **Content**: In-depth conversation with information references for complex situations.\n\n### Conversation Types\n\n- **Basic Conversation Level**: Focuses on fundamental communication tasks.\n- **Procedural Conversation**: Driven by fixed sequences and routines.\n- **Advanced Conversation**: Characterized by the nature of incidents or event scenarios.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that communication is clear, consistent, and adaptable to various operational contexts, enhancing safety and efficiency in train operations.",
        "2. Rules, Basic Syntax and Sentence Structure\n\nThis section outlines the rules and syntax for effective radio communication, focusing on structured sentence patterns and protocols.\n\n### A) Making a Group Call (only by control center, not individuals)\n- **Procedure**: The sender begins by stating:\n  - `<Receiver's Call Sign> this is <Sender's Call Sign>, <Message...>, over`\n  - Example: `<Car 45> this is <Mainline 01>, <Message...>, over`\n\n### B) Individuals Establishing a Call\n- **Procedure**: When a receiver's radio alert sounds, they respond with:\n  - `<Receiver's Call Sign>, send, over`\n  - Example: `<Car 45>, send, over`\n\n### C) Subsequent Radio Messages\n- **Procedure**: After the initial call, messages should start with the sender's call sign and end with \"out\":\n  - `<Your own Call Sign> <...Your Message...>, over`\n  - Example: `<Car 45>, <Message...>, over`\n\n### D) Leaving Radio Comms\n- **Procedure**: The sender concludes with \"over and out\":\n  - `<Your own Call Sign> <...Your Message...>, over and out`\n  - Example: `<Car 45>, <Message...>, over and out`\n\n### Conduct Half-Duplex Conversation\n- **Explanation**: Unlike full duplex, only one person can talk at a time. A 2-second pause is necessary, and each party ends with \"over\".\n- **Importance**: Using \"OVER\" or \"OUT\" signals the end of a message, allowing others to start their communication.\n  - **OVER**: Message transmission is complete, and the counterpart can respond.\n  - **OUT**: Conversation is complete, no further reply needed.\n\n### Read Back Message Practice\n- **Purpose**: Ensures messages are correctly understood and received.\n- **Application**: Used in scenarios like:\n  1. Safety situations\n  2. Protection arrangements\n  3. Possession & worksite boundaries\n  4. Change of vehicle operation modes\n  5. Movements of vehicles\n  6. Position of switches (Normal or Reverse)\n  7. OCS status ON/OFF\n\n### Alphabet Phonetics\n- **Usage**: Applied instead of letters like A, B, or C to avoid confusion in communication.",
        "**Phonetic Alphabet and Common Catch Phrases**\n\n**Phonetic Alphabet:**\n\nThe phonetic alphabet is used to ensure clear communication, especially in radio transmissions.
