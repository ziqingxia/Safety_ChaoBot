        "Practice of RC Comms\nIn the realm of communication dialogues, there are two main personas: the Control persona and the User, with the user often being a trainee.\n### 1. Control Centre Persona\nThe control centre, often led by a coach, guides the communication practice. This can occur in various scenarios, such as seeking entrance for track access. The Operations Control Centre (OCC) must follow specific protocols before granting authorization, including:\n- Providing a TOA (Track Occupancy Authority) number.\n- Stating a time limit (either a period or a specific time).\n- Specifying the method of track access protection (e.g., Standing Train Protection).\n- Reminding the TPO (Train Protection Officer) to update progress.\nThese protocols, along with other rules and terminologies, are captured in the \"Practice Portion\" to ensure consistent communication. The AI bot reinforces these practices by prompting users.\n### Examples of Communication Practice\nThe table illustrates typical interactions between the Player (TPO) and the Chatbot AI (acting as OCC):\n- **Unrecognizable chatter**: The AI prompts the user to identify themselves with a call-sign.\n- **Mainline 01**: The AI requests the user to identify with a call-sign.\n- **Mainline 01, TPO 'George'**: The AI instructs the user to use proper voice protocol and say \"Over\" after finishing.\n- **Mainline 01, TPO 'George', at Station 'twenty'**: The AI asks for proper numerical phonetics.\n- **Mainline 01, TPO 'George', recognize when to 'ANC'**: The AI requests proper phonetics.\n### Best Practices for Communication\nTrainees should adhere to the following guidelines for effective communication:\n- Maintain a natural rhythm.\n- Speak at a slightly slower pace than normal conversation.\n- Enunciate each word clearly without letting the voice fade.\n- Use a higher pitch tone for better transmission.\nIf the conversation becomes unclear, the AI may prompt the user to:\n- Repeat the call-sign.\n- State their intent.\n- Repeat the location.\n- Respond clearly.\n- Follow the checklist.\nIf the user speaks too quickly or the AI cannot recognize the words, the AI will advise: “Speak in a regular tone, and clearly, Over.”",
        "**AI Communication Protocol for Trainers**\nThe AI (RAM) will adopt the role of a coach or trainer in communication, guiding users or trainees in the following manner:\n. **Half-Duplex Communication**: Only one party speaks at a time, with a 2-second pause before the other responds.\n. **Use of Language**: Employ words and phrases from the designated dictionary, verbalizing and pronouncing them correctly. Use only authorized acronyms.\n. **Phonetic Alphabet**: Use phonetic terms like Alpha, Bravo, Charlie instead of letters for clarity.\n. **Numerical Clarity**: Enunciate numbers individually to avoid confusion, using terms like \"One,\" \"Three\" instead of longer forms.\n. **Call-Signs**: Always use established call-sign syntax.\n. **Radio Protocol**: Follow standard radio protocol and sentence structure.\n. **Identification**: All parties must identify themselves with a discrete call-sign.\n. **Message Clarity**: Ensure messages are clear and concise. Confirm understanding if unclear.\n. **Language and Jargon**: Use English without expletives, adhering to established jargon.\n. **Politeness**: Avoid excessive politeness to prevent unnecessary communication.\n. **Need-Based Communication**: Use radio comms only when necessary, especially for technical or operational matters.\n**Additional Practices for Each Talk-Group**:\n. **Radio Check**: Perform a radio check when entering a new talk group.\n. **Critical Work Messages**: Include a \"Read Back\" message for safety-critical communications.\n. **Single Addressee**: Send individual train movement messages to one addressee only, ensuring clarity.\nThe AI will guide users to speak properly, using the correct protocol and habits, and will also adhere to these standards.",
        "**Radio Communication Practices for Train Operations**\nThis document outlines the procedures for staff involved in train driving or manning duties to register their radio number with control, perform a radio check, and establish radio contact before starting train operations. The focus is on ensuring effective communication through a structured approach using a 3x3 matrix based on different conversation types and levels of complexity.\n### Talk Groups and Roles\n. **Operations**\n   - **Control**: RAM/AI assumes control; call-sign changes are noted.\n   - **Users**: User's role involves call-sign changes and context understanding.\n. **Station**\n   - **Control**: Similar to Operations, with specific call-sign changes.\n   - **Users**: Focus on station-specific call-signs and context.\n. **Depot/Engineering**\n   - **Control**: RAM/AI manages control with call-sign changes.\n   - **Users**: Emphasis on depot/engineering-specific call-signs and context.\n### Conversation Levels\n. **Basic Level**\n   - **Tasks**: Checking ID, radio check, clarifying, repeating, and using unique catchphrases.\n   - **Content**: Routine sequences and details provided for basic operations.\n. **Intermediate Level**\n   - **Tasks**: Use of acronyms, terminologies, and multiple scenarios.\n   - **Content**: More detailed procedural expressions and terminologies.\n. **Advanced Level**\n   - **Tasks**: Handling multiple scenarios and incidents with additional rules.\n   - **Content**: In-depth conversation with information references for complex situations.\n### Conversation Types\n- **Basic Conversation Level**: Focuses on fundamental communication tasks.\n- **Procedural Conversation**: Driven by fixed sequences and routines.\n- **Advanced Conversation**: Characterized by the nature of incidents or event scenarios.\nThis structured approach ensures that communication is clear, consistent, and adaptable to various operational contexts, enhancing safety and efficiency in train operations.",
        "2. Rules, Basic Syntax and Sentence Structure\nThis section outlines the rules and syntax for effective radio communication, focusing on structured sentence patterns and protocols.\n### A) Making a Group Call (only by control center, not individuals)\n- **Procedure**: The sender begins by stating:\n  - `<Receiver's Call Sign> this is <Sender's Call Sign>, <Message...>, over`\n  - Example: `<Car 45> this is <Mainline 01>, <Message...>, over`\n### B) Individuals Establishing a Call\n- **Procedure**: When a receiver's radio alert sounds, they respond with:\n  - `<Receiver's Call Sign>, send, over`\n  - Example: `<Car 45>, send, over`\n### C) Subsequent Radio Messages\n- **Procedure**: After the initial call, messages should start with the sender's call sign and end with \"out\":\n  - `<Your own Call Sign> <...Your Message...>, over`\n  - Example: `<Car 45>, <Message...>, over`\n### D) Leaving Radio Comms\n- **Procedure**: The sender concludes with \"over and out\":\n  - `<Your own Call Sign> <...Your Message...>, over and out`\n  - Example: `<Car 45>, <Message...>, over and out`\n### Conduct Half-Duplex Conversation\n- **Explanation**: Unlike full duplex, only one person can talk at a time. A 2-second pause is necessary, and each party ends with \"over\".\n- **Importance**: Using \"OVER\" or \"OUT\" signals the end of a message, allowing others to start their communication.\n  - **OVER**: Message transmission is complete, and the counterpart can respond.\n  - **OUT**: Conversation is complete, no further reply needed.\n### Read Back Message Practice\n- **Purpose**: Ensures messages are correctly understood and received.\n- **Application**: Used in scenarios like:\n  1. Safety situations\n  2. Protection arrangements\n  3. Possession & worksite boundaries\n  4. Change of vehicle operation modes\n  5. Movements of vehicles\n  6. Position of switches (Normal or Reverse)\n  7. OCS status ON/OFF\n### Alphabet Phonetics\n- **Usage**: Applied instead of letters like A, B, or C to avoid confusion in communication.",
        "**Phonetic Alphabet and Common Catch Phrases**\n**Phonetic Alphabet:**\nThe phonetic alphabet is used to ensure clear communication, especially in radio transmissions. Each letter of the alphabet is represented by a word:\n- A: Alpha\n- B: Bravo\n- C: Charlie\n- D: Delta\n- E: Echo\n- F: Foxtrot\n- G: Golf\n- H: Hotel\n- I: India\n- J: Juliet\n- K: Kilo\n- L: Lima\n- M: Mike\n- N: November\n- O: Oscar\n- P: Papa\n- Q: Quebec\n- R: Romeo\n- S: Sierra\n- T: Tango\n- U: Uniform\n- V: Victor\n- W: Whiskey\n- X: X-ray\n- Y: Yankee\n- Z: Zulu\n**Common Catch Phrases:**\n. **\"Roger\"**: Indicates that a message has been received and understood.\n. **\"Correct\" or \"Positive\"**: Confirms that a message has been correctly received.\n. **\"Say Again\"**: Used to request the sender to repeat the message.\n. **\"Wilco\" (Will Comply)**: Indicates that a message has been received, understood, and will be acted upon.\n. **\"Wait\"**: Indicates a pause in a message.\n. **\"Difficult\"**: Used when the signal is weak during a radio check.\n. **\"All stations\"**: Indicates a collective call to all radio stations in the same talk group.\n. **\"Emergency, Emergency\"**: Signals an emergency message.\n. **\"Figure\"**: Prefaces figures to be announced individually.\nThese phrases and the phonetic alphabet are essential for clear and effective communication, particularly in situations where clarity is crucial.",
        "**Radio Communication Phrases and Procedures**\nThis document outlines standardized phrases and procedures used in radio communication, particularly in operations involving traffic control and train services. These phrases ensure clarity and uniformity, especially in high-pressure or emergency situations.\n. **Time Format**: Uses a 24-hour format for clarity.\n. **\"Message\"**: Indicates that a message is to be sent.\n. **\"Okay\"**: Confirms that the signal received is satisfactory during a radio check.\n. **\"Out\"**: Signifies the end of a message, indicating no reply is needed.\n. **\"Over\"**: Marks the end of a message, indicating a reply is required.\n. **\"Radio check\"**: Used to verify the quality of a transmitted and received radio message.\n. **\"Read back message\"**: Requests the receiver to repeat the message to confirm receipt.\n. **\"Send\"**: Indicates readiness to receive a message.\n. **\"I Spell\"**: Prefaces words to be spelled using the Phonetic Alphabet.\n. **\"Wrong\" (or Negative)**: Indicates a message has been received incorrectly.\n. **\"Decimal\"**: Used to indicate a decimal point within a string of digits.\n**Specific Phrases for Talk-Group Activities:**\n. **\"Line Clear\"**: Confirms it is safe to switch on traction current and restart train services after maintenance or incidents.\n. **\"Proceed with Caution\"**: Advises train operators to move carefully, especially in hazardous conditions.\n. **\"Track Occupation Authority\" (TOA)**: A document detailing necessary isolations for track access.\n. **\"Track Circuit Failure\"**: Indicates a malfunction affecting signaling and track occupancy.\n. **Track Access**: Refers to entering an area on or near the track.\n. **Line Clear Message**: Similar to \"Line Clear,\" confirming safety for traction current and train services.\n. **Point Machine Detection**: An electro-mechanical process ensuring points are correctly set.\n. **Surrender TOA**: Indicates completion of work and readiness to issue a line clear message.\n. **Call-back Time**: The deadline for the Track Protection Officer or Possession Controller to return control to the OCC/DCC.\nThese phrases and procedures are crucial for maintaining safety and efficiency in train operations and communication.",
