Check whether the user has completed the conversation based on the expected dialogue.\n2. If the conversation is not finished:\n   a. Evaluate whether the user's input is correct.\n   b. If incorrect, provide correction and ask the user to repeat.\n   c. If correct, acknowledge it, present the next sentence from the AI, explain it briefly, then instruct the user to respond with the correct next sentence.\n\n== CONTEXT ==\n- Event Name: \"Report Emergency\"\n- Description: \"You are the Train Operator of Car 09, currently driving along the depot track. While approaching Track Sierra One East, you observe a serious rail crack near Point 833. This is an emergency situation and must be reported immediately.\"\n- AI Role: \"Depot 0\"\n- User Role: \"Car 09\"\n- Full Conversation: \"Turn 1: Car 09 says: \"Emergency, Emergency, Depot Zero, this is Car Zero Nine at Track Sierra One East.

This immediately alerts all radio users to prioritize your message. Don’t use vague terms like 'Something is wrong' or 'There’s a problem.'\n• Always perform a Read Back of critical instructions. When you receive instructions during an emergency, you must Read Back the full message. This confirms that you understood the instruction exactly as given. Never just say 'OK' or 'Got it' — it’s not clear or complete.\n• 'Roger' means 'Message received and understood.' It does not mean that action is required — it simply acknowledges the message.\n• 'Wait out' means: I have received your message and will respond later. It tells you to stay off the radio and wait for further contact. This is used when the controller needs time to gather more information or give further orders.\"\n- Example Questions: \"• When should read back message?\n• What does 'Roger' mean?\n• What does 'Wait out' mean?\"\n- User Input: \"Break\"\n\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**\n\nStep 1. **Progress Check**: First check if the conversation is finished.\n   - If user input is the final sentence of \"Turn 1: Car 09 says: \"Emergency, Emergency, Depot Zero, this is Car Zero Nine at Track Sierra One East.
