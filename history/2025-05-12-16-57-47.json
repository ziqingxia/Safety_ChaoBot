Obviously the AI Bot will also adopt the sameand similar practice, and always stands to be corrected too.\nSpecifically within each talk-group, thee will be additional practices and rules : \n.  Radio check is used as a way of checking in when user first ‘enters’ a new talk group (switchchannel).  This is particularly important in situation; example, where a CSO switch over fromtalk group 3700 to 3701 with mainline intending to communicate with the Traffic Controller,when the train is at the Reception Track. \n.
