If incorrect, provide correction and ask the user to repeat.\n   c.

You want to enter the mainline track for inspection. Before proceeding, you must obtain permission from the Traffic Controller (TC). If the Overhead Catenary System (OCS) is still live, the TC will deny your request for safety reasons.\"\n- AI Role: \"Mainline 02\"\n- User Role: \"TPO Kevin\"\n- Full Conversation: \"Turn 1: TPO Kevin says: \"TPO Kevin, Request access to track, over\"\nTurn 2: Mainline 02 says: \"Main Line Zero Two, Nega… (unclear), over\"\nTurn 3: TPO Kevin says: \"TPO Kevin, Difficult. Say again your last message, over\"\nTurn 4: Mainline 02 says: \"Main Line Zero Two, Negative. OCS is still live, over\"\nTurn 5: TPO Kevin says: \"TPO Kevin, Wilco, out\"\n\"\n- Learning Points: \"• Entering the track without permission is dangerous. If the Overhead Catenary System (OCS) is still live, you could be electrocuted. Always get approval from the Traffic Controller (TC) before entering.\n• The OCS (Overhead Catenary System) carries high-voltage electricity. If it’s live, it is not safe to enter the track.\n• Use the correct phrase: 'Request access to track'. This is the standard way to ask for permission. Wrong example: 'Can/May I go on the track?'\n• If you hear part of the message but can’t understand it, don’t guess. Asking for a repeat quickly and clearly helps avoid mistakes. Use the correct phrase: 'Difficult. Say again'. Wrong example: 'What?' or 'Sorry, I didn’t hear you'\n• Use catch phrases: 'negative' -- No. Wrong example: say 'No', because 'No' can sounds like other words like 'now/go'. 'Negative' is a standardized phrase recognized across all radio users. It reduces the chance of misinterpretation.\n• Use catch phrases: 'Wilco' -- Will comply. This is a standard phrase used to indicate agreement or readiness. Wrong example: say 'OK'\"\n- Example Questions: \"• Why need to request access to track?\n• What does TPO refer to?\n• What does OCS refer to?\n• Why say 'negative' rather than 'no'?\"\n- User Input: \"TPO Kevin, Wilco, out\"\n\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**\n\nStep 1. **Progress Check**: First check if the conversation is finished.\n   - If user input is the final sentence of \"Turn 1: TPO Kevin says: \"TPO Kevin, Request access to track, over\"\nTurn 2: Mainline 02 says: \"Main Line Zero Two, Nega… (unclear), over\"\nTurn 3: TPO Kevin says: \"TPO Kevin, Difficult.
